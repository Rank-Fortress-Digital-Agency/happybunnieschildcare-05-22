                Is it a Tantrum or a Meltdown?
            </h2>
            <p>
                Identifying if your child is throwing a tantrum or having a meltdown is important. While they seem the same, they are quite different.
            </p>
            <p>
                Tantrums occur when your child does not get what they want. Meltdowns, on the other hand, happen when your child is overwhelmed by emotions or the environment.

                Why Children Throw Tantrums
            </h2>
            <p>
                Young children are still in the early stages of development. As a result, they are unable to express their feelings or communicate what they want.
            </p>
            <p>
                This causes them to feel frustrated and they throw tantrums to express their dissatisfaction. Tantrums can occur when children are exhausted, hungry, or unhappy.
            </p>
            <p>
                They may have a meltdown if they are unable to get what they want at that time. You may notice your child cry, scream and shout when they don’t get a toy.
            </p>
            <p>
                At this stage, they also learn their actions have an impact on others. When they throw tantrums, they notice the adults around them act on them. It is simply their way of getting your attention to get what they want.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over time, children develop the ability to deal with frustration. Tantrums and meltdowns begin to reduce as they learn language skills.

                How to Handle Your Child’s Temper Tantrums
            </h2>
            <p>
                Tantrums should be viewed as an opportunity to learn about your child rather than a crisis. There is no definite method for handling temper tantrums in children.
            </p>
            <p>
                But, there are many things you can do to enable good behavior in your child. This will help prevent future tantrums.
            </p>
            <p>
                Below are ways to handle your child’s temper tantrums

            <h2>
                Identify Tantrum Triggers
            </h2>
            <p>
                While this may seem difficult, it is possible. Look out for patterns when your child throws a tantrum. You may notice they get upset when they don’t get a particular thing or when they are hungry.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because they can not communicate properly, this will help you know what they really want. Knowing why your child is frustrated is the first step to handling the situation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Identifying triggers will also enable you to prepare ahead of time. You will know when your child is hungry and prepare ahead of time.

            <h2>
                Ignore the Situation
            </h2>
            <p>
                You must understand that a tantrum is a tactic your child uses to get what they want. Throwing tantrums is not a behavior you should tolerate.
            </p>
            <p>
                Children may throw tantrums if you refuse to give them a toy or buy them ice cream. Ignore the situation if they want something you don’t want to give.
            </p>
            <p>
                Note that, you can only ignore the situation if they are out of physical harm. Don’t ignore the situation if the tantrum is a result of genuine needs like hunger or thirst.
            </p>
            <p>
                This can only work in some instances and must not be the case all the time.

                Create a Daily Routine
            </h2>
            <p>
                Create a daily routine for your child. This would enable them to know what to expect. Follow this routine as consistently as possible.
            </p>
            <p>
                For instance, you can set a time for naptime, playtime, and bedtime. If your child is well-rested, tantrums will reduce.

                Present Them With Choices
            </h2>
            <p>
                Sometimes, tantrums occur when your child needs options. You don’t always have to say ‘no’ to them. Present them with different alternatives they can choose from.
            </p>
            <p>
                This will make them know you acknowledge their concerns.

                Why Children have Meltdowns
            </h2>
            <p>
                Depending on the child, different circumstances can cause a meltdown. Fear and anxiety are examples.
            </p>
            <p>
                Children have meltdowns when they receive too much on their senses. Sounds and sights can overstimulate the brain.
            </p>
            <p>
                Children get overwhelmed while trying to process everything around them. When your child has a meltdown, they are dependent on you to help them feel better.
            </p>
            <p>
                Meltdown is common in children with undiagnosed learning disabilities and those who have experienced trauma.

                        Your child relies on you and to help them, you need to be patient. During a meltdown, your child does not have control over their emotions and actions.

                At daycare, children make friends and learn skills that will benefit them. Children learn to resolve conflicts and share their feelings. This will help improve their communication skills.
